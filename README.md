# ViewFlipperExample  
An Android App implementing ViewFlipper i.e. automatically sliding different images on a screen.  
It can be used for Initial Splash Screens Wizards!  
If it is helpful to you then follow me (you can give it a star too), I will make some more useful standard codes..  
Happy Coding :)
