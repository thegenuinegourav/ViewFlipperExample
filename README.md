# ViewFlipperExample  
An Android App implementing ViewFlipper i.e. automatically sliding different images on a screen.  
It can be used for Initial Splash Screens Wizards!  
The demo video of the app is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYAm7dZAtuQ).  
If it is helpful to you then follow me (you can give it a star too), I will make some more useful standard codes..  
Happy Coding :)
